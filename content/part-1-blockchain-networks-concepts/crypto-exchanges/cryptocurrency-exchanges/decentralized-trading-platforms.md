# Decentralized Trading Platforms

In this chapter, we'll look at some of the more popular decentralized exchanges. The decentralized exchanges do not rely on a third party service to hold the customer's funds. Instead, trades occur directly between users through an automated process.  Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges require users to register for an account before they can trade.

Some of this exchanges use proxy tokens that represent a certain fiat or crypto currency. Others use assets that are like shares in a company. Another way to achieve decentralisation is using of a decentralized multi-signature escrow system.

Using decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges brings a lot of benefits. Many decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are hosted on decentralized servers or existing solely in the cloud. This make decentralized exchanges much harder to hack than traditionally hosted exchanges. Decentralization gives more security to user data and funds. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are much harder to regulate or even shut down by the government. This reduces political risk.

Decentralized exchanges require the registration of a trading account. But unlike traditional exchanges, they require much less information, allowing users to maintain a much more privacy.

When people use centralized exchanges, they lost control over private keys and have only records in exchange database. Decentralized exchanges on the other hand leave ownership of cryptocurrency in the hands of their users and simply act as a place for peer-to-peer trading.

Decentralized exchanges are less used than traditional ones, which is reflected in weaker liquidity. Generally, they are more complex to use and create difficulties for new users. The weak regulation of this type of exchanges is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Very often it is not known who is behind these exchanges and who controls them.

Stellar is open-source, distributed payments infrastructure. The Stellar network \(Horizon API and Stellar Core\) is a distributed blockchain based ledger and database that facilitates cross-asset transfers of value, including payments. The native cryptocurrency of Stellar is called Lumens \(XLM\). Stellar has a small testnet open to developers.

Stellar-core is the backbone of the Stellar network. It maintains a local copy of the ledger, communicating and staying in sync with other instances of stellar-core on the network. Optionally, stellar-core can store historical records of the ledger and participate in consensus. 

Stellar-core is a replicated state machine that maintains a local copy of a cryptographic ledger and processes transactions against it, in consensus with a set of peers. It implements the Stellar Consensus Protocol, a federated consensus protocol. It is written in C++11 and runs on Linux, OSX and Windows. Learn more by reading the overview document.

Horizon is the client-facing API server for the Stellar ecosystem. It acts as the interface between Stellar Core and applications that want to access the Stellar network. Horizon allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams. For more details, see an overview of the Stellar network.



You can interact directly with Horizon via cURL or a web browser. Stellar.org also provides a JavaScript SDK for clients to use to interact with Horizon.
