# What is Truffle
Truffle is a framework for smart contract development. With Truffle you can compile, deploy, test and make a User Interface for your smart contracts. It is very useful when you have many contracts and complex architecture, because you can automate some processes. 

Truffle has a package manager called **EthPm** which can help you with installing libraries. It follows the **ERC190**[^1] standard for publishing and consuming smart contract packages. Also we have a **Truffle console** that is similar to the **Geth console** and you can use it to interact with the contract faster.

[^1]: ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment and it is a proposal for improving the ecosystem.
